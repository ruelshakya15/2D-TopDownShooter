# 2D_TopDownShooter 
Game developed with the intentions of learning and getting a grasp of game development using C# and Unity.

It is a basic game which can in the future be a template to more complex 
and layered game. The current game being developed is an action-based top-down shooter, 
in which unlike first person shooters the user has a wide field of view of the general action 
area.
